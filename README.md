Path Under Everything

Put/Create path blocks under anything! Feel free to use any of the code for yourself. 

Current bugs:

Any block that requires a full block below it can not be placed and will break if the block below is turned into a path block. I have found one way of fixing this for most of these blocks but I am unsatisfied with the amount of bloated code it would require.
